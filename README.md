# oh noes it needs a CDN

After getting hit by social networks bandwidth became prohibitive, so enter a
CDN from the nice folks at [EdgeCast](http://edgecast.com).  During high traffic
periods, you may find your self redirected to [/meow](http://edgecats.net/meow),which serves a cacheable image from /cats.
